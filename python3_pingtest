#To use this code, create a text file named ip_addresses.txt and put one IP address per line. 
#Then, save the above code to a file with a .py extension (e.g. pingtest.py) and run it with the command python3 pingtest.py. 
#The script will read the IP addresses from the ip_addresses.txt file, perform a ping test on each one, and display the results. 
#Note that this implementation uses os.popen() to run the ping command and capture its output.


import os

# Open the text file containing IP addresses
with open('ip_addresses.txt', 'r') as f:
    ip_addresses = f.readlines()

# Loop through the IP addresses and perform a ping test on each one
for ip in ip_addresses:
    ip = ip.strip() # Remove any newline characters
    ping_command = f"ping -c 3 {ip}"
    ping_output = os.popen(ping_command).read()

    # Check the output to determine if the ping test was successful
    if '3 received' in ping_output:
        status = 'UP'
