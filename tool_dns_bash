#This script reads each line from the input file specified by the input_file variable and stores it in the ip_address variable. 
#It then uses the nslookup command to perform an nslookup for the current IP address and extracts the hostname from the output using the awk command.
#The awk command searches for the string "name =" in the output of the nslookup command and prints the last field (i.e., the hostname) from the line that contains this string.
#Finally, the script prints the IP address and hostname result, separated by a tab character (\t), using the echo command. The -e option tells echo to interpret escape sequences such as \t.

#!/bin/bash

# Set the path to the input file

# Loop through each line in the input file
while read -r ip_address; do
    # Perform an nslookup for the current IP address
    ns_result=$(nslookup "$ip_address" | awk '/name =/{print $NF}')

    # Print the IP address and hostname result, separated by a tab character
